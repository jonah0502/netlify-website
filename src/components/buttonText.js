          <p>Tagflix is an open source, movie cataloguing and review service that allow users to create, read, update and delete reviews for over 5000 movies. They can also filter the movies by Genre, IMDB Score, Year Range, and title. We also allow the users to filter by custom descriptors or "tags" as we call them. If the movie they are looking for does not exist in our database they have the ability to make a new movie entry. This website works well on both desktop and mobile.</p>
          <p>This is all done through my custom built API which uses mongoDB Atlas for the backend.Â  The API is hosted remotely on MongoDB Realm but you can still find the source code in the linked GitHub repo.</p>
